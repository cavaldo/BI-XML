                  <h3 class="subsection">Background</h3>
                  <p>Hungary became a Christian kingdom in A.D. 1000 and for many centuries served as a
                     bulwark against Ottoman Turkish expansion in Europe. The kingdom eventually became
                     part of the polyglot Austro-Hungarian Empire, which collapsed during World War I.
                     The country fell under communist rule following World War II. In 1956, a revolt and
                     an announced withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact were met with a massive military intervention
                     by Moscow. Under the leadership of Janos KADAR in 1968, Hungary began liberalizing
                     its economy, introducing so-called "Goulash Communism." Hungary held its first multiparty
                     elections in 1990 and initiated a free market economy. It joined NATO in 1999 and
                     the EU five years later.</p>

                     <li>etymology: the Hungarian capital city was formed in 1873 from the merger of three
                        cities on opposite banks of the Danube: Buda and Obuda (Old Buda) on the western shore
                        and Pest on the eastern; the origins of the original names are obscure, but according
                        to the second century A.D. geographer, Ptolemy, the settlement that would become Pest
                        was called "Pession" in ancient times; "Buda" may derive from either a Slavic or Turkic
                        personal name</li>

               <section>
                  <h3 class="subsection">Economy - overview</h3>
                  <p>Hungary has transitioned from a centrally planned to a market-driven economy with
                     a per capita income approximately two thirds of the EU-28 average; however, in recent
                     years the government has become more involved in managing the economy. Budapest has
                     implemented unorthodox economic policies to boost household consumption and has relied
                     on EU-funded development projects to generate growth. Following the fall of communism
                     in 1990, Hungary experienced a drop-off in exports and financial assistance from the
                     former Soviet Union. Hungary embarked on a series of economic reforms, including privatization
                     of state-owned enterprises and reduction of social spending programs, to shift from
                     a centrally planned to a market-driven economy, and to reorient its economy towards
                     trade with the West. These efforts helped to spur growth, attract investment, and
                     reduce Hungary’s debt burden and fiscal deficits. Despite these reforms, living conditions
                     for the average Hungarian initially deteriorated as inflation increased and unemployment
                     reached double digits. Conditions slowly improved over the 1990s as the reforms came
                     to fruition and export growth accelerated. Economic policies instituted during that
                     decade helped position Hungary to join the European Union in 2004. Hungary has not
                     yet joined the euro-zone. Hungary suffered a historic economic contraction as a result
                     of the global economic slowdown in 2008-09 as export demand and domestic consumption
                     dropped, prompting it to take an IMF-EU financial assistance package. Since 2010,
                     the government has backpedaled on many economic reforms and taken a more populist
                     approach towards economic management. The government has favored national industries
                     and government-linked businesses through legislation, regulation, and public procurements.
                     In 2011 and 2014, Hungary nationalized private pension funds, which squeezed financial
                     service providers out of the system, but also helped Hungary curb its public debt
                     and lower its budget deficit to below 3% of GDP, as subsequent pension contributions
                     have been channeled into the state-managed pension fund. Hungary’s public debt (at
                     74.5% of GDP) is still high compared to EU peers in Central Europe. Real GDP growth
                     has been robust in the past few years due to increased EU funding, higher EU demand
                     for Hungarian exports, and a rebound in domestic household consumption. To further
                     boost household consumption ahead of the 2018 election, the government embarked on
                     a six-year phased increase to minimum wages and public sector salaries, decreased
                     taxes on foodstuffs and services, cut the personal income tax from 16% to 15%, and
                     implemented a uniform 9% business tax for small and medium-sized enterprises and large
                     companies. Real GDP growth slowed in 2016 due to a cyclical decrease in EU funding,
                     but increased to 3.8% in 2017 as the government pre-financed EU funded projects ahead
                     of the 2018 election. Systemic economic challenges include pervasive corruption, labor
                     shortages driven by demographic declines and migration, widespread poverty in rural
                     areas, vulnerabilities to changes in demand for exports, and a heavy reliance on Russian
                     energy imports.</p>
