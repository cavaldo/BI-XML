      <h3>background</h3>
      <div>Hungary became a Christian kingdom in A.D. 1000 and for many centuries served as a
         bulwark against Ottoman Turkish expansion in Europe. The kingdom eventually became
         part of the polyglot Austro-Hungarian Empire, which collapsed during World War I.
         The country fell under communist rule following World War II. In 1956, a revolt and
         an announced withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact were met with a massive military intervention
         by Moscow. Under the leadership of Janos KADAR in 1968, Hungary began liberalizing
         its economy, introducing so-called "Goulash Communism." Hungary held its first multiparty
         elections in 1990 and initiated a free market economy. It joined NATO in 1999 and
         the EU five years later.</div>

         to the second century A.D. geographer, Ptolemy, the settlement that would become Pest

      <h2>Economy</h2>
      <h3>Economy - overview</h3>
      <div>Hungary has transitioned from a centrally planned to a market-driven economy with
         a per capita income approximately two thirds of the EU-28 average; however, in recent
         years the government has become more involved in managing the economy. Budapest has
         implemented unorthodox economic policies to boost household consumption and has relied
         on EU-funded development projects to generate growth. Following the fall of communism
         in 1990, Hungary experienced a drop-off in exports and financial assistance from the
         former Soviet Union. Hungary embarked on a series of economic reforms, including privatization
         of state-owned enterprises and reduction of social spending programs, to shift from
         a centrally planned to a market-driven economy, and to reorient its economy towards
         trade with the West. These efforts helped to spur growth, attract investment, and
         reduce Hungary’s debt burden and fiscal deficits. Despite these reforms, living conditions
         for the average Hungarian initially deteriorated as inflation increased and unemployment
         reached double digits. Conditions slowly improved over the 1990s as the reforms came
         to fruition and export growth accelerated. Economic policies instituted during that
         decade helped position Hungary to join the European Union in 2004. Hungary has not
         yet joined the euro-zone. Hungary suffered a historic economic contraction as a result
         of the global economic slowdown in 2008-09 as export demand and domestic consumption
         dropped, prompting it to take an IMF-EU financial assistance package. Since 2010,
         the government has backpedaled on many economic reforms and taken a more populist
         approach towards economic management. The government has favored national industries
         and government-linked businesses through legislation, regulation, and public procurements.
         In 2011 and 2014, Hungary nationalized private pension funds, which squeezed financial
         service providers out of the system, but also helped Hungary curb its public debt
         and lower its budget deficit to below 3% of GDP, as subsequent pension contributions
         have been channeled into the state-managed pension fund. Hungary’s public debt (at
         74.5% of GDP) is still high compared to EU peers in Central Europe. Real GDP growth
         has been robust in the past few years due to increased EU funding, higher EU demand
         for Hungarian exports, and a rebound in domestic household consumption. To further
         boost household consumption ahead of the 2018 election, the government embarked on
         a six-year phased increase to minimum wages and public sector salaries, decreased
         taxes on foodstuffs and services, cut the personal income tax from 16% to 15%, and
         implemented a uniform 9% business tax for small and medium-sized enterprises and large
         companies. Real GDP growth slowed in 2016 due to a cyclical decrease in EU funding,
         but increased to 3.8% in 2017 as the government pre-financed EU funded projects ahead
         of the 2018 election. Systemic economic challenges include pervasive corruption, labor
         shortages driven by demographic declines and migration, widespread poverty in rural
         areas, vulnerabilities to changes in demand for exports, and a heavy reliance on Russian
         energy imports.</div>
