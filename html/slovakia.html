      <h3>background</h3>
      <div>Slovakia traces its roots to the 9th century state of Great Moravia. Subsequently,
         the Slovaks became part of the Hungarian Kingdom, where they remained for the next
         1,000 years. After the formation of the dual Austro-Hungarian monarchy in 1867, backlash
         to language and education policies favoring the use of Hungarian (Magyarization) encouraged
         the strengthening of Slovak nationalism and a cultivation of cultural ties with the
         closely related Czechs, who fell administratively under the Austrian half of the empire.
         After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the close of World War I,
         the Slovaks joined the Czechs to form Czechoslovakia. The new state was envisioned
         as a nation with Czech and Slovak branches. During the interwar period, Slovak nationalist
         leaders pushed for autonomy within Czechoslovakia, and in 1939 Slovakia became an
         independent state created by and allied with Nazi Germany. Following World War II,
         Czechoslovakia was reconstituted and came under communist rule within Soviet-dominated
         Eastern Europe. In 1968, an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops ended the efforts of Czechoslovakia's
         leaders to liberalize communist rule and create "socialism with a human face," ushering
         in a period of repression known as "normalization." The peaceful "Velvet Revolution"
         swept the Communist Party from power at the end of 1989 and inaugurated a return to
         democratic rule and a market economy. On 1 January 1993, Czechoslovakia underwent
         a nonviolent "velvet divorce" into its two national components, Slovakia and the Czech
         Republic. Slovakia joined both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004 and the euro
         zone on 1 January 2009.</div>

      <h2>Economy</h2>
      <h3>Economy - overview</h3>
      <div>Slovakia’s economy suffered from a slow start in the first years after its separation
         from the Czech Republic in 1993, due to the country’s authoritarian leadership and
         high levels of corruption, but economic reforms implemented after 1998 have placed
         Slovakia on a path of strong growth. With a population of 5.4 million, the Slovak
         Republic has a small, open economy driven mainly by automobile and electronics exports,
         which account for more than 80% of GDP. Slovakia joined the EU in 2004 and the euro
         zone in 2009. The country’s banking sector is sound and predominantly foreign owned.
         Slovakia has been a regional FDI champion for several years, attractive due to a relatively
         low-cost yet skilled labor force, and a favorable geographic location in the heart
         of Central Europe. Exports and investment have been key drivers of Slovakia’s robust
         growth in recent years. The unemployment rate fell to historical lows in 2017, and
         rising wages fueled increased consumption, which played a more prominent role in 2017
         GDP growth. A favorable outlook for the Eurozone suggests continued strong growth
         prospects for Slovakia during the next few years, although inflation is also expected
         to pick up. Among the most pressing domestic issues potentially threatening the attractiveness
         of the Slovak market are shortages in the qualified labor force, persistent corruption
         issues, and an inadequate judiciary, as well as a slow transition to an innovation-based
         economy. The energy sector in particular is characterized by unpredictable regulatory
         oversight and high costs, in part driven by government interference in regulated tariffs.
         Moreover, the government’s attempts to maintain low household energy prices could
         harm the profitability of domestic energy firms while undercutting energy efficiency
         initiatives.</div>
