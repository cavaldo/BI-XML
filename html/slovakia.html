                  <h3 class="subsection">Background</h3>
                  <p>Slovakia traces its roots to the 9th century state of Great Moravia. Subsequently,
                     the Slovaks became part of the Hungarian Kingdom, where they remained for the next
                     1,000 years. After the formation of the dual Austro-Hungarian monarchy in 1867, backlash
                     to language and education policies favoring the use of Hungarian (Magyarization) encouraged
                     the strengthening of Slovak nationalism and a cultivation of cultural ties with the
                     closely related Czechs, who fell administratively under the Austrian half of the empire.
                     After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the close of World War I,
                     the Slovaks joined the Czechs to form Czechoslovakia. The new state was envisioned
                     as a nation with Czech and Slovak branches. During the interwar period, Slovak nationalist
                     leaders pushed for autonomy within Czechoslovakia, and in 1939 Slovakia became an
                     independent state created by and allied with Nazi Germany. Following World War II,
                     Czechoslovakia was reconstituted and came under communist rule within Soviet-dominated
                     Eastern Europe. In 1968, an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops ended the efforts of Czechoslovakia's
                     leaders to liberalize communist rule and create "socialism with a human face," ushering
                     in a period of repression known as "normalization." The peaceful "Velvet Revolution"
                     swept the Communist Party from power at the end of 1989 and inaugurated a return to
                     democratic rule and a market economy. On 1 January 1993, Czechoslovakia underwent
                     a nonviolent "velvet divorce" into its two national components, Slovakia and the Czech
                     Republic. Slovakia joined both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004 and the euro
                     zone on 1 January 2009.</p>

                  <h3 class="subsection">Economy - overview</h3>
                  <p>Slovakia’s economy suffered from a slow start in the first years after its separation
                     from the Czech Republic in 1993, due to the country’s authoritarian leadership and
                     high levels of corruption, but economic reforms implemented after 1998 have placed
                     Slovakia on a path of strong growth. With a population of 5.4 million, the Slovak
                     Republic has a small, open economy driven mainly by automobile and electronics exports,
                     which account for more than 80% of GDP. Slovakia joined the EU in 2004 and the euro
                     zone in 2009. The country’s banking sector is sound and predominantly foreign owned.
                     Slovakia has been a regional FDI champion for several years, attractive due to a relatively
                     low-cost yet skilled labor force, and a favorable geographic location in the heart
                     of Central Europe. Exports and investment have been key drivers of Slovakia’s robust
                     growth in recent years. The unemployment rate fell to historical lows in 2017, and
                     rising wages fueled increased consumption, which played a more prominent role in 2017
                     GDP growth. A favorable outlook for the Eurozone suggests continued strong growth
                     prospects for Slovakia during the next few years, although inflation is also expected
                     to pick up. Among the most pressing domestic issues potentially threatening the attractiveness
                     of the Slovak market are shortages in the qualified labor force, persistent corruption
                     issues, and an inadequate judiciary, as well as a slow transition to an innovation-based
                     economy. The energy sector in particular is characterized by unpredictable regulatory
                     oversight and high costs, in part driven by government interference in regulated tariffs.
                     Moreover, the government’s attempts to maintain low household energy prices could
                     harm the profitability of domestic energy firms while undercutting energy efficiency
                     initiatives.</p>
