                  <h3 class="subsection">Background</h3>
                  <p>Finland was a province and then a grand duchy under Sweden from the 12th to the 19th
                     centuries, and an autonomous grand duchy of Russia after 1809. It gained complete
                     independence in 1917. During World War II, Finland successfully defended its independence
                     through cooperation with Germany and resisted subsequent invasions by the Soviet Union
                     - albeit with some loss of territory. In the subsequent half century, Finland transformed
                     from a farm/forest economy to a diversified modern industrial economy; per capita
                     income is among the highest in Western Europe. A member of the EU since 1995, Finland
                     was the only Nordic state to join the euro single currency at its initiation in January
                     1999. In the 21st century, the key features of Finland's modern welfare state are
                     high quality education, promotion of equality, and a national social welfare system
                     - currently challenged by an aging population and the fluctuations of an export-driven
                     economy.</p>

                  <h3 class="subsection">Economy - overview</h3>
                  <p>Finland has a highly industrialized, largely free-market economy with per capita GDP
                     almost as high as that of Austria and the Netherlands and slightly above that of Germany
                     and Belgium. Trade is important, with exports accounting for over one-third of GDP
                     in recent years. The government is open to, and actively takes steps to attract, foreign
                     direct investment. Finland is historically competitive in manufacturing, particularly
                     in the wood, metals, engineering, telecommunications, and electronics industries.
                     Finland excels in export of technology as well as promotion of startups in the information
                     and communications technology, gaming, cleantech, and biotechnology sectors. Except
                     for timber and several minerals, Finland depends on imports of raw materials, energy,
                     and some components for manufactured goods. Because of the cold climate, agricultural
                     development is limited to maintaining self-sufficiency in basic products. Forestry,
                     an important export industry, provides a secondary occupation for the rural population.
                     Finland had been one of the best performing economies within the EU before 2009 and
                     its banks and financial markets avoided the worst of global financial crisis. However,
                     the world slowdown hit exports and domestic demand hard in that year, causing Finland’s
                     economy to contract from 2012 to 2014. The recession affected general government finances
                     and the debt ratio. The economy returned to growth in 2016, posting a 1.9% GDP increase
                     before growing an estimated 3.3% in 2017, supported by a strong increase in investment,
                     private consumption, and net exports. Finnish economists expect GDP to grow a rate
                     of 2-3% in the next few years. Finland's main challenges will be reducing high labor
                     costs and boosting demand for its exports. In June 2016, the government enacted a
                     Competitiveness Pact aimed at reducing labor costs, increasing hours worked, and introducing
                     more flexibility into the wage bargaining system. As a result, wage growth was nearly
                     flat in 2017. The Government was also seeking to reform the health care system and
                     social services. In the long term, Finland must address a rapidly aging population
                     and decreasing productivity in traditional industries that threaten competitiveness,
                     fiscal sustainability, and economic growth.</p>
