                  <h3 class="subsection">Background</h3>
                  <p>Once the center of power for the large Austro-Hungarian Empire, Austria was reduced
                     to a small republic after its defeat in World War I. Following annexation by Nazi
                     Germany in 1938 and subsequent occupation by the victorious Allies in 1945, Austria's
                     status remained unclear for a decade. A State Treaty signed in 1955 ended the occupation,
                     recognized Austria's independence, and forbade unification with Germany. A constitutional
                     law that same year declared the country's "perpetual neutrality" as a condition for
                     Soviet military withdrawal. The Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 and Austria's entry
                     into the EU in 1995 have altered the meaning of this neutrality. A prosperous, democratic
                     country, Austria entered the EU Economic and Monetary Union in 1999.</p>

                  <h3 class="subsection">Economy - overview</h3>
                  <p>Austria is a well-developed market economy with skilled labor force and high standard
                     of living. It is closely tied to other EU economies, especially Germany's, but also
                     the US’, its third-largest trade partner. Its economy features a large service sector,
                     a sound industrial sector, and a small, but highly developed agricultural sector.
                     Austrian economic growth strengthen in 2017, with a 2.9% increase in GDP. Austrian
                     exports, accounting for around 60% of the GDP, were up 8.2% in 2017. Austria’s unemployment
                     rate fell by 0.3% to 5.5%, which is low by European standards, but still at its second
                     highest rate since the end of World War II, driven by an increased number of refugees
                     and EU migrants entering the labor market. Austria's fiscal position compares favorably
                     with other euro-zone countries. The budget deficit stood at a low 0.7% of GDP in 2017
                     and public debt declined again to 78.4% of GDP in 2017, after reaching a post-war
                     high 84.6% in 2015. The Austrian government has announced it plans to balance the
                     fiscal budget in 2019. Several external risks, such as Austrian banks' exposure to
                     Central and Eastern Europe, the refugee crisis, and continued unrest in Russia/Ukraine,
                     eased in 2017, but are still a factor for the Austrian economy. Exposure to the Russian
                     banking sector and a deep energy relationship with Russia present additional risks.
                     Austria elected a new pro-business government in October 2017 that campaigned on promises
                     to reduce bureaucracy, improve public sector efficiency, reduce labor market protections,
                     and provide positive investment incentives.</p>

                  <p>registration requirement at age 17, the legal minimum age for voluntary military service;
                     18 is the legal minimum age for compulsory military service (6 months), or optionally,
                     alternative civil/community service (9 months); males 18 to 50 years old in the militia
                     or inactive reserve are subject to compulsory service; in a January 2012 referendum,
                     a majority of Austrians voted in favor of retaining the system of compulsory military
                     service (with the option of alternative/non-military service) instead of switching
                     to a professional army system (2015)</p>
