      <h2>introduction</h2>
      <h3>background</h3>
      <div>Once the center of power for the large Austro-Hungarian Empire, Austria was reduced
         to a small republic after its defeat in World War I. Following annexation by Nazi
         Germany in 1938 and subsequent occupation by the victorious Allies in 1945, Austria's
         status remained unclear for a decade. A State Treaty signed in 1955 ended the occupation,
         recognized Austria's independence, and forbade unification with Germany. A constitutional
         law that same year declared the country's "perpetual neutrality" as a condition for
         Soviet military withdrawal. The Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 and Austria's entry
         into the EU in 1995 have altered the meaning of this neutrality. A prosperous, democratic
         country, Austria entered the EU Economic and Monetary Union in 1999.</div>

         conventional short form: Austria
         local long form: Republik Oesterreich

      <h2>Economy</h2>
      <h3>Economy - overview</h3>
      <div>Austria is a well-developed market economy with skilled labor force and high standard
         of living. It is closely tied to other EU economies, especially Germany's, but also
         the US’, its third-largest trade partner. Its economy features a large service sector,
         a sound industrial sector, and a small, but highly developed agricultural sector.
         Austrian economic growth strengthen in 2017, with a 2.9% increase in GDP. Austrian
         exports, accounting for around 60% of the GDP, were up 8.2% in 2017. Austria’s unemployment
         rate fell by 0.3% to 5.5%, which is low by European standards, but still at its second
         highest rate since the end of World War II, driven by an increased number of refugees
         and EU migrants entering the labor market. Austria's fiscal position compares favorably
         with other euro-zone countries. The budget deficit stood at a low 0.7% of GDP in 2017
         and public debt declined again to 78.4% of GDP in 2017, after reaching a post-war
         high 84.6% in 2015. The Austrian government has announced it plans to balance the
         fiscal budget in 2019. Several external risks, such as Austrian banks' exposure to
         Central and Eastern Europe, the refugee crisis, and continued unrest in Russia/Ukraine,
         eased in 2017, but are still a factor for the Austrian economy. Exposure to the Russian
         banking sector and a deep energy relationship with Russia present additional risks.
         Austria elected a new pro-business government in October 2017 that campaigned on promises
         to reduce bureaucracy, improve public sector efficiency, reduce labor market protections,
         and provide positive investment incentives.</div>
